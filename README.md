Android Skills you will learn üéñÔ∏è

In this assignment, you will develop a more comprehensive event management Android application. This application project will be the next phase of the project you implemented as part of Assignment 2. Please read Assignment 1 to find out more about the theme for this unit's assignments (event management app).

Note: as emphasised previously, the relationship between category and events is one-to-many. i.e. one category can contain one or more events. But one event can only be part of one category.

You will extend your previous assignment to add the following new functionality:

    Store events & event categories using the Room Database library. This will allow you to understand how database CRUD (Create Read Update & Delete) operations work in a database.

    Host external webpages within the app using WebView, without relying on the default web browser on the phone.

    Use the embedded Google Map libraries to show a category's location on the Map and leverage Geocoder to decode user-provided input to a physical address.

    Allow users to interact with your app using Gestures. (by ingesting TouchEvent(s) and translating them into Android Gestures) 

By combining these elements, you'll create a more advanced Android application.
